                <p class="abtMe">I'm a dreamer, an artist, and passionate about whatever I do. Growing up as a child, photography was my one interest. Being able to capture things, memories, feelings, into a still photograph was mindblowing to me, and it still is today. 
                    A good photographer strives to capture all those things and many more. I have spent almost all my life trying to perfect my photography skills. My friends and clients have told me I can capture the smells and sounds through the picture. I started photography
                    when I was young, and I will never stop doing it. Beyond photography, I love being active. I am really social and like interacing with people, so if you see me, feel free to wave hi!

                    <p>When I'm not taking pictures, I'm playing my favorite sport, Soccer. I have been playing it since I was very young, and I'm decently good at it. My friends can stil beat me easily</p>
                    <p>I played on many soccer teams in my youth, and in my school years. I still enjoy getting out on the field and kicking the ball around</p>

                    <p>Video Games. Yes, I play video games. Sometimes I just want to relax and unwind, and video games is sometimes my outlet for that. I love all types of games, and I grew up with them.</p>
                    <p>My favorite games of all time would definetly be the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Spider Man. I also love playing with my friends!</p>

                    <p>The languages I am most proficient with are python and java, and it is where I do a lot of my coding. I love making things with my hands, and this is how I do it!</p>

                    <p class="abtMe">My name is Nav! I've known Amogh for a long time, and when he told me he was starting a photography business, I was the first on the list! I am the resident expert at sports photography. I always loved playing sports as a kid, on top of taking photos. I decided to merge the two and become a sports photographer. Being able to capture the emotions of the players mid-stride, celebrating, or anything in between is so exciting for me. Outside of photography, I love being there for my 2 year old daughter, Julie, and my wife, Mandra. Spending time with them means more to me than any photos. I also really like playing games, usually with my family. My wife's favorites are Just Dance and Twister, while I'm more of a Mariokart guy!</p>

                    <p class="abtMe">I'm John! I love all types of photography, but I'm certainly the expert on portrait photography. After I graduated from art school, I met up with my old friend Amogh and asked him what he was doing. He aksed me if I was interested in joining his photography company. I didn't know what I would make of my life at that point, so I decided to join and see if it was any fun. A few years later, and I still love working here! After I'm done taking photos, I like playing with my dogs, Fluffy and Fang. Going outdoors with my dogs is so fun to me, and I often bring my camera during my hikes, just in case I get any opportunities to take some photos. A photographer isn't a photographer without his camera!</p>

                    <p class="abtMe">What's Up! My name is Laura. Ever since I was a kid, I loved taking pictures. Portrait, animal, landscape. You name it. I would always be there with my camera, taking pictures of whatever I could see. At first, I wasn't very good. Most of my pictures were blurry messes. However, after I grew up a little more and was able to refine my craft, my pictures got a lot better, and my parents started to take notice. They convinced me to go to an art school, and I passed it with flying colors. I love photography to this day, and being able to turn this into a job is like a dream come true for me. While I am pretty proficient in all types of photography, I am the best at wedding photos. It's just so exciting to be able to capture the strong feelings of weddings in a photo!</p>
